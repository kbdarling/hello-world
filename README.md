# hello-world
Creating first repository on GitHub.

Presently, I am a copyeditor and proofreader.
I am learning how to code with the intention of changing the trajectory of my life with regard to the work that I do and the career that I pursue. This is my first day using GitHub and Learn.co.

I am interested in cartography, maps, and urban planning.

I am a student of history and culture  and am particularly curious about what people's lives were like in Cold War Europe, resistance and revolutionary movments from the 1930s to the 1980s, Japanese culture and its relationship to political and social change prior to the Twentieth Century, among many other eras and aspects of history and culture.

I read a great many books that span from genre fiction to literature, histories to critiques of society and culture, and whatever else I find interesting in a given moment.
